# Front End Coding Exercise

For this exercise, you will be developing (from scratch) a JavaScript based system to present a DHTML invitation on a website to sign up for a mailing list. This system should (at a minimum):

 - Be able to trigger the invitation only after the user has been on the site for x seconds.
 - Be able to trigger the invite after a certain number of pages have been visited.
 - Allow for easy customization of the invitation.

The invitation dialog itself should be DHTML based and use best practices for CSS and HTML. Your JavaScript should be clean, and use OO best practices. Please do not use any 3rd party libraries like jQuery, Angular, React, or others.
